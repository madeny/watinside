Decluttering can feel like a mountain you can't climb. The trick is to start small.

1.  **The 5-Minute Rule**: Spend just 5 minutes a day clearing one small area. A drawer, a shelf, a corner.
2.  **The "Maybe" Box**: Put items you aren't sure about in a box. Seal it. If you haven't opened it in 6 months, donate it.
3.  **One In, One Out**: For every new item you bring into your home, let one go.

Using an app like **WatInside** helps you visualize what you own, making it easier to identify duplicates and items you simply don't need anymore.
