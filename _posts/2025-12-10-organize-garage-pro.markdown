Is your garage a dumping ground for everything that doesn't fit in the house? You are not alone. Here is how to take back your space.

### Zone Your Space
Create specific zones for different categories:
*   Garden tools
*   Sports equipment
*   Car supplies
*   Holiday decorations

### Utilize Vertical Space
Install shelves and hooks. Get things off the floor. This not only clears space but protects items from water damage.

### Digital Inventory
Use **WatInside** to catalogue your storage bins. When you need the Christmas lights next year, you won't have to open five different boxes to find them. Just search "Christmas lights" in the app!
