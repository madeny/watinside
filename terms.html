    <p class="legal-updated">Last updated: December 2025</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
      <p>By downloading, installing, or using WatInside ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the App.</p>
      <p>If you are using a Beta or TestFlight version of the App, you acknowledge that the software is in testing, may contain bugs, and may result in data loss. You use Beta software entirely at your own risk.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Description of Service</h2>
      <p>WatInside is a local-first mobile application designed to help you organize and track your physical belongings using manual input, photos, NFC tags, and QR codes. The App relies on your device's storage and your personal iCloud account for data synchronization.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Accounts & iCloud</h2>
      <p>WatInside does not create or manage proprietary user accounts. Your identity within the App is tied strictly to your Apple ID. By using the App, you acknowledge that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Apple ID and iCloud credentials.</li>
        <li>Data synchronization is handled by Apple’s iCloud services, over which we have no control.</li>
        <li>We cannot reset passwords or recover access to your data if you lose access to your Apple account.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AI Features & Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>The App includes optional features that use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze photos for automatic tagging. By using these features, you acknowledge that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Image data may be processed by third-party providers (such as OpenAI or Google Gemini) solely for the purpose of analysis.</li>
        <li>AI suggestions are provided "as is" and may be inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
        <li>We are not responsible for any errors in tagging or classification generated by AI.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose.</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the App.</li>
        <li>Use the App to track illegal contraband or hazardous materials.</li>
        <li>Interfere with the App’s functionality or attempt to compromise the integrity of the App Store distribution mechanism.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Content & Ownership</h2>
      <p>You retain full ownership of all content you create within the App (inventory lists, photos, box names). We do not claim ownership of your data.</p>
      <p>Because your data is stored on your device and your personal iCloud, <strong>we do not have access to your content</strong>. Consequently, we cannot sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not guarantee that the App will be error-free, that data synchronization will be instant, or that the App will meet your specific requirements.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer of WatInside shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Loss:</strong> Loss of inventory records, photos, or database corruption resulting from App updates, iCloud sync errors, or device failure.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Interruption:</strong> Inability to access your data due to Apple iCloud outages.</li>
        <li><strong>Beta Usage:</strong> Any damages resulting from the use of TestFlight/Beta versions of the software.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your sole remedy for dissatisfaction with the App is to stop using the App.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the developer of WatInside from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses arising out of your use of the App or your violation of these Terms.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms. Significant changes will be communicated via App Store release notes or in-app notifications.</p>
