Moving house is often cited as one of the most stressful life events. However, with a little planning and the right tools, you can significantly reduce the anxiety.

## 1. Start Early
Don't wait until the week before. Start packing non-essential items weeks in advance.

## 2. Label Everything
This is where **WatInside** shines. Instead of just writing "Kitchen" on a box, scan a QR code and know exactly what's inside.

## 3. Declutter First
Don't move things you don't need. Sell, donate, or recycle items before you pack.

## 4. Pack an Essentials Box
Pack a box with toiletries, a change of clothes, and basic kitchen supplies that travels with you, not on the truck.

## 5. Take Photos
Take photos of your electronics setups before unplugging them. It makes reassembly much easier.
