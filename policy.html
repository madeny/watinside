    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: <strong>May 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>Watinside is designed to protect your privacy. Your data lives <strong>on your device</strong> and, if you choose to, it can be synchronized with your <strong>private iCloud account</strong> using Apple’s <strong>CloudKit</strong> framework. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or track any personal data on our servers.</p>

    <h2>2. What Data Is Stored</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage Names, Item Photos, Tags, Notes</strong>: Stored locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>iCloud Sync</strong>: If iCloud is enabled, your data is synced privately between your devices using your Apple ID via CloudKit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. No Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>Your data is <strong>never</strong> sent to any third-party servers such as GitHub or Cloudinary.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feedback and bug reports that include optional screenshots are uploaded anonymously using a temporary link to Cloudinary <strong>only when you explicitly send feedback</strong>.</li>
        <li>GitHub is used solely to submit feedback and bug reports via issues, but no personal data or app data is ever transmitted automatically.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        Deleting the Watinside app from your device <strong>does not automatically delete your data from iCloud</strong>.
        However, you can delete all your stored data—including synced iCloud data—by using the <strong>“Reset All Data”</strong> option from within the app's settings, as long as your iCloud account is still connected.
    </p>

    <h2>5. User Control</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Data stays fully in your control.</li>
        <li>You can choose to skip iCloud entirely and use Watinside offline.</li>
        <li>At any time, you can clear all app data via the settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Contact</h2>
